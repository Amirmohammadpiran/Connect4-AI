# Connect4-AI
In this repository I have implemented the Connect-4 (CLI and Graphical) game using PyGame in four stages:

**1-multiplayer**
**2-AI with minimax and no heuristic**
**3-AI with minimax and heuristic**
**4-AI with alpha beta pruning minimax and heuristic**

The controls are:
Left arrow key to move the piece to left,
Right arrow key to move the piece to left,
Enter or Space key to drop the piece.
