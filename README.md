# Connect4-AI
In this repository I have implemented the Connect-4 (CLI and Graphical) game using PyGame in four stages:

**1-multiplayer**

**2-AI with minimax and no heuristic**

**3-AI with minimax and heuristic**

**4-AI with alpha beta pruning minimax and heuristic**

The controls are:

Left arrow key to move the piece to left,

Right arrow key to move the piece to right,

Enter or Space key to drop the piece.
